# calculator
Final project for CS 140 at Binghamton University. A very simple calculator made with Swing. The skeleton for this program's GUI will be utilized for gradeTracker, a project of mine that I am working on to get better with GUIs.

I made this for Thomas Bartenstein's CS 140 class. I have no plans to update it.
